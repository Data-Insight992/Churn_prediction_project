# Churn_prediction_project

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription (i.e. churn) based on historical behavioral and demographic data. By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, including Probit Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, I preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis and train models to predict churn with high accuracy.
